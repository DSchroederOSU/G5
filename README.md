#Assignment
You're building a website that has a "Car Repair Appointment" feature:

1. User requests an appointment, and provides their email address. Â The website sends an activation email to their email account.
2. User clicks a link in activation email, which takes them to a form where they enter their first name, last name, phone number, year, make, model, repair required and preferred appointment date/time.
3. Once this form is submitted they should be presented with a success screen and a confirmation email should be sent to the user. A "Car Repair Appointment" email should be delivered to repairs@example.com with the users information, their car repair request information, appointment date/time and the IP address used to fill out the form.
4. If the user clicks the activation email link or tries to fill out the form again, the user should be presented with their already submitted data (except the ip address), with an opportunity to rate their experience on a scale of 1-5.

Views don't need to be styled in any way; plain HTML elements with no CSS at all is fine. You can use whatever libraries, gems or packages you want.
